# Project Damson

Custom programming for my hexapod robot, Damson.

## About

Damson is based on the [Freenove Hexapod Robot Kit](http://www.freenove.com). The Arduino library (`ProjectDamson`) is a modified fork of Freenove's FNHR library with:
- RF24 remote code removed (I don't have the physical remote)
- Renamed classes and files
- Custom Wi-Fi SSID ("Damson")
- Future: smooth movement, animations, autonomous behaviors
